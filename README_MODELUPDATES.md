Material Band Model



To Do: 

Research and adjust batch size and learning rate. 

Create Code Block to run model on one material vs. background. 

Research and Implement Keras Loss function into learning model. 

Create Code Block to normalize Label Data Distribution. 

Research Logistic Regression/Feature Importance and Determine usability in initializing linear correlation of spectral response.

-Concerns with DSTL - 
Datatype for model.fit() with json files

-First Successful Rit18 Run with decreasing accuracy. Learning rate needs to be adjusted

-Begining attempting to run the RIT18 data to the model, created a copy of the model to do so for the time being. Ideally the model will be able to accept multiple datasets but i currently need to understand more of the consderations involved before being able to take that step, for now i simply created a copy of the model to use for the RIT18 data.

-Block to input current working directory and input files was created for ease of use.
-Currently need to figure validity of DSTL as input and attempted to input DSTL but after meeting with peter it seems focus should be on data manipulation
-Rit18 data ready as backup and I will continue to work
-Added Directory call for user input
